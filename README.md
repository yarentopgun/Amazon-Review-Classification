# Amazon-Review-Classification

This project focuses on classifying **Amazon product reviews** as positive, negative, or neutral using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The dataset contains **72,500 reviews** with titles, review texts, and star ratings (1â€“5).

## Project Overview
The project implements a **NaÃ¯ve Bayes text classifier from scratch** using the **Bag of Words (BoW)** methodology. Reviews are processed into unigrams, bigrams (and optionally trigrams) for classification.

- **Classification Strategy:**
  - 1â€“2 stars â†’ Negative  
  - 4â€“5 stars â†’ Positive  
  - 3 stars â†’ Neutral or optionally dismissed (depending on approach, reasoning explained in notebook).  
  - Weighting applied: stronger negativity for 1-star reviews and stronger positivity for 5-star reviews.  
  - Titles and contents considered separately or together with appropriate weighting.

- **Algorithms and Features:**  
  - Bag of Words dictionary (custom implementation).  
  - NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier (custom implementation).  
  - Logarithmic probabilities to avoid underflow.  
  - Laplace smoothing and unknown word handling.  

- **Evaluation metrics:**  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  
  - Confusion Matrix  

- **Validation:**  
  - 80/20 train-test split

## Bonus Section
As an extension, additional models can be compared:  
- **Word Embeddings + Logistic Regression** (Word2Vec, GloVe).  
- **NLTK-based BoW + NaÃ¯ve Bayes** (for benchmarking only).  
- Results compared with the custom NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier.
